    <h1>Hi there! Welcome to your shiny new website!</h1>
    <p>Take some time to get to know Atom. It looks complicated and technical but it's really quite simple.</p>
    <p>Atom is like Microsoft Word, but it is for writing code, not English. You type your code and save it, just like in Word.</p>
    <p>You can see if your file has unsaved changes by looking at the tab at the top. If it has a blue dot, you need to save. You can save by pressing Control + S (or Command + S on Mac) or by using the "File" menu and clicking "Save".</p>
    <p>This file is an HTML file. You can tell because it uses "< >" brackets, and because the file is a ".html" file.</p>
    <p>Have a look at the files in the folder you just downloaded. Some of them are HTML files, some are CSS files, and there's an image. Can you see which is which?</p>
    <p>Once you feel comfortable with the files, you can jump right in and change this text. Write something about yourself!</p>
